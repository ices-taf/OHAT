### Assessment plots and statistical analysis

This report provides details of the assessment of alpha-HCH
concentrations in common shrimp at station BCP.

<ul>

<li class="gap">

Timeseries metadata. Key information about the timeseries.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Assessment plot. The fitted trend (solid line) with pointwise 90%
confidence bands (grey shaded areas). The trend is plotted on the log
scale, with the axis labels back-transformed for ease of interpretation.
The points are the annual medians of the individual log concentration
measurements.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Trend with data. The fitted trend with pointwise 90% confidence bands.
The points are the individual concentration measurements, with a \<
denoting a less-than value.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Auxiliary data. The individual concentration measurements with
supporting information: mean length of the individuals in the sample;
dry weight (%) of the sample; lipid weight (%) of the sample.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Assessment (related compounds). Assessment plots for all the compounds
in the same chemical group.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Data (related compounds). A scatter plot matrix of the individual
concentration measurements for all the compounds in the same chemical
group.
