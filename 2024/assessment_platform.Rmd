#### Statistical analysis

<br>

**Trend assessment**


```{asis, eval = !anova_ok & !info$group %in% c("Effects", "Imposex")}
There are too few years, or too many less-than values, for a trend assessment.
<br>
```

```{asis, eval = !anova_ok & info$group %in% "Effects"}
There are too few years for a trend assessment.
<br>
```

```{asis, eval = !anova_ok & info$group %in% "Imposex"}
There is no trend assessment because there are too few years (or occasionally because all the measurements are zero).
<br>
```
